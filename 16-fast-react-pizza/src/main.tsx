/**
 * what i have learned
 * 1. introducing ts for the first time in a project
 * 2. how to make profissional file structure (based on features)
 * 3. learn how to make AppLayout (don't have routes): this is the fixed part that is always visible and its children are rendered based in Outlet when its path match the url -> paths can really be anything
 * 3. react-router for fetching data
 * in previous project you have used:
 *    fetch on render : means that the request is fired off after the component render
 *    but now you are using: fetch as render: the request and component render are fired together
 * step:
 *    1. define the loader function -> it is convension to put the definition inside the component page
 *    2. provide the loader function to the react-router so that it can fire the request with the page start to render
 *    3. consume the retuned data in the component using (useLoaderData: Returns the data from the closest route loader or clientLoader.)
 * 4. now react router is not responsible for matching url with the correct page only but also for providing data to that page (wow)
 * 5. use useNavigation hook to get the global state (: idle , loading, submitting)
 * 6. use handle error using react-router : just assign errorElement that will be rendered when a certain loader or action faild (error bubbles up the tree)
 *    useRouteError to get access to the error message.
 * 7. use react-router form to make actions post , update the server states
 * what is happening there
 *    <Form> submit   →  React Router intercepts
                      →  creates Request
                      →  calls action(request)
                      →  you process formData and make real API call
                      →  return data or redirect
                      →  UI updates automatically
 * from validation using const errors = useActionData(); to get the returned errors object that is validated in the action
